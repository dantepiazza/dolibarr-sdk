# Dolibarr API Rest SDK

## Installation

The recommended way to install this package is via the Packagist Dependency Manager ([dantepiazza/dolibarr-sdk](https://packagist.org/packages/dantepiazza/dolibarr-sdk)). 

## Getting Started

```php
$dolibarr = new Dolibarr([
	'url' => 'YOUR_DOLIBAR_API_URL',
	'token' => 'YOUR_DOLIBAR_API_TOKEN',
]);

$invoice = $dolibarr -> Invoices -> Get(1);

if($invoice -> status){
    print_r($invoice -> data);
}
```

The call to the different Dolibarr endpoints is made through the defined instance invoking the class and the corresponding method:


```php
$call = $dolibarr -> endpoint_class_name -> method_name(array $options);
```

You can see a detail of the different endpoints by exploring your API from the URL `YOUR_DOLIBAR_API_URL/api/index.php/explorer`
